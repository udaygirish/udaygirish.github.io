## What is Computer Vision??

Computer Vision is nothing but mimicking human vision to achieve human level performance on day to day tasks and automate mundane tasks.


#### Sub-Divisions

Computer Vision is a bigger sub branch in Artificial Intelligence, Some of the important subbranches of Computer Vision are: <br>
<ul>    
    <li> Image Classification </li>
    <li> Object Detection </li>
    <li> Pose Estimation </li>
    <li> Person Re-identification </li>
    <li> 3D Depth Estimation </li>
    <li> Image Superresolution </li>
    <li> Generative art/Augmentation using GANs </li>
</ul>
<br>
So on..


## Next...

So in this series of blogs weâ€™re gonna talk about each topic in a detailed fashion with state of art performance metrics on different devices and across different frameworks and architectures..

### Stay Tuned.... :)
