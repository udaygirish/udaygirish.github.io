## What is Computer Vision??

Computer Vision is nothing but mimicking human vision to achieve human level performance on day to day tasks and automate mundane tasks.


### Sub-Divisions

Computer Vision is a bigger sub branch in Artificial Intelligence, Some of the important subbranches of Computer Vision are: <br>
<ul> 
    <li> Image Classification </li>
    <li> Object Detection </li>
    <li> Pose Estimation </li>
    <li> Person Re-identification </li>
    <li> 3D Depth Estimation </li>
    <li> Image Superresolution </li>
    <li> Generative art/Augmentation using GANs </li>
</ul>
<br>
So on..

### Different Approaches 

As told above there are many sub divisions of computer vision , there are many approaches with which we can solve the use cases. <br>
Some of the important approaches used in industry to solve these problems are:
<br>
<ul>
    <li> Traditional Image Processing </li>
    <li> Traditional Machine Learning Hybrid Combinations </li>
    <li> Deep Learning - Neural Networks (Convolutional Neural Networks) </li>
</ul>
<br>


### Different Softwares /Frameworks used

Some of the famous softwares, frameworks or tools used in industry to solve these problems are:
<ul>
    <li> Traditional Image Processing : OpenCV </li>
    <li> Visualisations and Basic I/O Operations: Matplotlib, PIL, Seaborn </li>
    <li> Traditional Machine Learning :  Scikit-Learn </li>
    <li> Deep Learning : Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, MXNet, Caffe </li>
</ul>
<br>

### Data Sources

In computer vision use cases there are many open source repositories , private repos with commercial, research and education licenses.
<br>
Some of the famous benchmark datasets/ Data formats include:
<ul>
    <li> Image Net Dataset </li>
    <li> COCO (Common Objects in Context) </li>
    <li> Pascal VOC </li>
</ul>
<br>
Those three are the common benchmark datasets and use case specific datasets are many and they will be listed in a detailed manner in this series of blogs.
<br>


### Metrics Used

Some of the metrics on which we measure the performance of the algorithm are:
<ul>
    <li> Precision </li>
    <li> F1-Score </li>
    <li> Accuracy </li>
    <li> Recall </li>
    <li> AOU Score </li>
    <li> Visual Performance Evaluation</li>
</ul>

So in this series of blogs weâ€™re gonna talk about each topic in a detailed fashion with state of art performance metrics on different devices and across different frameworks and architectures..
