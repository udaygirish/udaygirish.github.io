### Gaming

1. Desktop Gaming

    Ai in Desktop Gaming is a common thing which is being used by Activision, Rockstar like game companies  from the past decade to give Human like experience while playing games and to decide strategies.

    → Non Player Character Behaviour Modelling

    → AI  Bots ( Using DRL)

    → Path finding

    → Simulated realities

    → Gaming Consoles - Kinect  and Stereo Powered

2.  Cloud Gaming

 → AI bots

 → Player Analytics

---

### VFX and Films

→ Face Simulation and Animation

→ Image denoising

→ Character animation

→ Texture creation

→ Image Enhancements

→ Facial Pose Estimation, Correction

→ Environment and Object generation

→ Rotoscoping, Masking

→ Pose estimation based motion Capture

→ Superresolution

Techniques mostly contain different Supervised and Adversarial approaches.

Low Power CV 

What is Low Power CV ?

1. Edge or Mobile Computer Vision
2. Microcontroller based Computer Vision

**Edge or Mobile Computer Vision**

 **Power Ranges:  5V - 24 V DC , 1-8 A** 

**Programming Languages : Python, C++** 

- Use of  Onboard Edge Devices in multiple fields now a days is most common.
- Some of the famous edge devices are:
    1. Jetson Nano
    2. Jetson Xavier AGX
    3. Jetson Xavier NX
    4. Google Compute TPU USB Adapter or Google Compute TPU Board
    5. Raspberry Pi
    6. Asus Boards etc.
- Edge Devices can be connected to SDKs and can be used in different deployment methods to optimise costs.
    - AWS GreenGrass
    - GCP IOT
    - Azure IOT
    - With the help of open-source SDK's
        - Some of them are:
            1. Kafka
            2. Kubernetes
            3. ROS

**Deployment Frameworks:**

1. Tensorflow Lite
2. Triton models (.trt, .engine)
3. OpenVino IR Models

**Microcontroller based Computer Vision**

**Power Ranges:  3.3 - 9V DC, 0.1 - 2 A**

**Programming Languages : Micropython , C++ , Assembly C**

What are these devices for?

These are basically very low powered devices used for mostly Single task based Computer Vision in a more efficient manner and consuming as less current as possible.
